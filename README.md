# IOT-ENABLED HOME SMART PLUG
This project is designed to help send data from the home smart plug circuit microproccessor to the google firebase database, and also to help retrieve data from the firebase database to an MIT app.
Often a trigger comes from the MIT app to turn on or turn off the home smart plug from any location.
